                    <p>
                    <a href="http://www.scrum.org" target="_bank">Scrum</a> theory includes time-boxing,
                    and specific roles, rules, and artifacts.
                    All elements of Scrum complement each other to form a consistent whole.
                    All work is performed in Sprints. All base rules, events, and roles are described
                    in the Scrum Guide, the acknowledged Scrum body of knowledge. Each part of Scrum
                    ties back to the principles and theory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This is foundational knowledge for every Scrum Team member and anyone involved with Scrum.
                    Product Owners know how to take advantage of the business opportunities unlocked with the Scrum
                    framework in delivering value to the market place every 30 days, or less.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Scrum Theory and Principles</h3>
                    Scrum is founded on empirical process theory to deal with the complexity
                    typical to software development. All principles and values of Scrum are based
                    on the fundamental view of software development as creative and complex work.
                    Scrum Masters know how Scrum implements empiricism in software development. They explain how the
                    Scrum principles tie back to the empirical nature of Scrum, and how they are fundamentally different
                    from those of more traditional software development approaches.
                    Scrum Masters understand the impact of the transparency that Scrum brings and requires, and how
                    Scrum is best used to increase an organization’s agility.

                    <h3>Cross-functional, Self-organizing Teams</h3>
                    Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional; which is very different from
                    traditional development groups.
                    Product Owners acknowledge the self-organizing skills of Development Teams and how Development Teams
                    organize their development work in creating Done Increments of product. Product Owners understand
                    how their accountability is complementary to that of a Development Team, and not conflicting.

                    <h3>VALUE DOMAIN</h3>
                    <h3>Maximizing Value</h3>
                    Scrum is a foundation to unlock business agility. Scrum in itself however is–by
                    design–incomplete. Agility will be much higher if Scrum is complemented by strategies
                    for Agile product management and when metrics are in place to track the creation and delivery
                    of value to the market place.

                    <h3>Product Backlog Management</h3>
                    <p>
                    A Product Owner is accountable for the Product Backlog, and the ordering of all work that is
                    identified for the product. Product Backlog is used to manage the requirements and can be used
                    to plan releases, and track and report on progress.
                    </p>

            <p>
            The Professional Scrum Product Owner (PSPO) course is a 2-day course on how

            </p>
            <p>
            Product Ownership in Scrum today requires more than knowledge of how
            to write requirements or manage a Product Backlog. Professional Scrum
            Product Owners need to have a concrete understanding of everything that
            drives value from their products.
            </p>
            <p>
            Students develop and solidify this understanding through instruction
            and team-based exercises. The breadth of the role's responsibilities in
            delivering a successful product becomes clear from an Agile perspective on
            product management. Metrics are identified to track the creation of value
            and the successful delivery of it to the marketplace. This defines the
            perspective from which the role of the Product Owner in the Scrum framework
            is taught.

          <h3>Topics Day 1</h3>
          <ul>
          <li>
            Agile management is the new approach to leadership
            and governance of creative teams and people. You will
            learn about different methods, popular practices, challenges
            in Agile adoption around the world, and the contribution of the
            manager and team leader in Agile organizations;
          </li>
          <li>
            Complexity thinking is the cornerstone of an Agile mindset.
            You will learn what complexity theory is, how to think in terms of
            systems, about the difference between complex and complicated, about
            fallacies of traditional linear thinking, and suggestions for complexity
            thinking;
          </li>
          <li>
            Intrinsic motivation is the reason people get out of bed in the morning.
            Since people are the most important parts of an organization and managers
            must do all they can to keep people active, creative, and motivated.
            You will learn about the difference between extrinsic vs. intrinsic
            motivation, the 10 intrinsic desires, and common techniques for understanding what is
            important to the people in your teams, such as one-on-one meetings,
            personal assessments, the 12 most important questions, and 360 degree evaluations;
          </li>
          <li>
            Self-organization can offer many answers when it comes to good management.
            Teams are able to self-organize, but this requires empowerment,
            authorization, and trust from management. You will learn how to make
            self-organization work, how to distribute authorization in an organization,
            the challenges of empowerment, how to grow relationships of trust, and
            several techniques for distributed control, such as the 7 levels of delegation, and authority boards;
          </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Topics Day 2</h3>
          <ul>
          <li>
            Goal setting is important, since self-organization can lead to anything.
            Therefore it’s necessary to protect people and shared resources, and to
            give people a clear purpose and defined goals. You will learn when to manage
            and when to lead, how to use different criteria to create useful goals, about
            the challenges around management by objectives, and how to protect people and shared
            resources from any bad effects of self-organization.
          </li>
          <li>
            Competence development is key when it comes to doing a good job.
            Teams are only able to achieve their goals if team members are capable enough,
            and managers must therefore contribute to the development of competence. You will
            learn how and when to apply the seven approaches of competence development, how to
            measure progress in a complex system, the effect of sub-optimization, and several tips
            for useful metrics;
          </li>
          <li>
            Organizational structures significantly impact how an organization works. Many teams operate
            within the context of a complex organization, and thus it is important to consider structures
            that enhance communication. You will learn how to grow an organizational structure as a fractal,
            how to balance specialization and generalization, how to choose between functional and cross-functional
            teams, about informal leadership and widening job titles, and about treating teams as value units in a value
            network;
          </li>
          <li>
            Change management is one of the things people in all kinds of organizations struggle
            with most. People, teams, and organizations need to improve continuously, in order to defer failure
            for as long as possible. In practice this means that managers and leaders must act as change agents,
            trying to change the social complex systems around them. You will learn about the 4 facets of change
            management, which address the system, the individuals, the interactions, and the boundary of the system.
          </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Games and Exercises</h3>
          <p>
          Each of the eight topics includes at least one game or exercise.
          In groups of four to six people, attendees put into practice the
          ideas they’ve just learned. Sometimes the attendees play as different
          managers against each other. Sometimes they act together as one manager,
          sharing their thoughts while working on a problem.
          Every social activity ends with a debrief and a discussion, so that people can
          relate what they’ve learned to their own situation, and bring up
          questions and experiences to be addressed by the whole group.
